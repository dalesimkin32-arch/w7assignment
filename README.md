# w7assignment

got data base created on Supabase using coPilot generated seed data as in dbaseseeddata.txt

got server side running for get at root ; and get(all) at /usefulgenes
and post /usefulgenes (single row update)
tested all OK via POSTman app.

First git commit

server side completed - will render and correct URLs after next commit
client side getting there: renders list of genes and gene info from database, via server side
form updates to Database OK via server
route pages OK Nav bar added uses routing

next: tidy pages and make pretty with CSS, make sure all base criteria done, add extras

taking for-ever to source alternative image so got some into d/base then left it

CSS mostly OK, but could not get background image to behave as I wanted: goes weird on screen resize and page re-loads / on the form page. CSS has minimal controls for background images so may be best to use a generated pattern and image with clear background

CSS color may not be quite right but is "aliceblue" may be better as lightcyan.

added second dia change as it seemed to be better

can't get any further as time at weekend and in evenings reduced by caring requirements etc.
